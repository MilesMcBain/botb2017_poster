  abstract  = "Determining the time when the climate change signal from
               increasing greenhouse gases exceeds and thus emerges from
               natural climate variability (referred to as the time of
               emergence, ToE) is an important climate change issue1. Previous
               ToE studies were mainly focused on atmospheric
               variables2,3,4,5,6,7. Here, based on three regional sea-level
               projection products available to 2100, which have increasing
               complexity in terms of included processes, we estimate the ToE
               for sea-level changes relative to the reference period
               1986--2005. The dynamic sea level derived from ocean density and
               circulation changes alone leads to emergence over only limited
               regions. By adding the global-ocean thermal expansion effect,
               50\% of the ocean area will show emergence with rising sea level
               by the early-to-middle 2040s. Including additional contributions
               from land ice mass loss, land water storage change and glacial
               isostatic adjustment generally enhances the signal of regional
               sea-level rise (except in some regions with decreasing total sea
               levels), which leads to emergence over more than 50\% of the
               ocean area by 2020. The ToE for total sea level is substantially
               earlier than that for surface air temperature and exhibits
               little dependence on the emission scenarios, which means that
               our society will face detectable sea-level change and its
               potential impacts earlier than surface air warming.",
